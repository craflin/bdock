BDock
=====

BDock is a very basic dock style launcher for Windows 7.
It hides the Windows taskbar and adds an overlay (the Dock) to your desktop.
The Dock lists all running applications similar to the taskbar and allows you to switch between the windows on your desktop.
The Windows taskbar (and the Windows start menu) can be recovered using the Windows key.
BDock was not tested on any other version of Windows than Windows 7 64-bit.

BDock is written in C++ without any third party libraries or toolkits. 
You need Visual Studio 2010 (or newer) if you want to compile it yourself.
